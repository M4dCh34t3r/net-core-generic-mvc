# net-core-generic-mvc
## What is this project about?
This is one of those super generic item list CRUD aplications.

## How do I run this thing?
Just open the _.sln_ and let the magic happen. The project runs on SQLServer, so keep that in mind.

## Why tho?
~Yes.~ The author wanted to try some Razor Pages stuff in the .NET env.
